## Overview

This project showcases a complete CI/CD pipeline with integrated monitoring that automates the software development lifecycle. It leverages modern DevOps tools to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure solution for continuous delivery and monitoring of a Python Flask application.

The implementation focuses on DevOps best practices including:
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Containerization
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment with GitOps
- Automated Testing
- Code Quality Enforcement
- Comprehensive Monitoring
- Multi-Environment Support

## Core Principles

This project embodies several core DevOps principles:

1. **Automation**: Eliminate manual processes through automation of building, testing, and deployment
2. **Continuous Integration**: Frequent code integration with automated verification
3. **Continuous Delivery**: Reliable, low-risk deployments through automation
4. **GitOps**: Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application deployment
5. **Shift Left**: Early testing, security scanning, and quality checks
6. **Infrastructure as Code**: Define and version infrastructure alongside application code
7. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and metrics collection
8. **Environment Parity**: Consistent configurations across environments

## Architecture

The architecture integrates several key components:

1. **Version Control (GitLab)**: Central repository for application code, Helm charts, and deployment configurations
2. **CI Pipeline (Jenkins)**: Orchestrates building, testing, and artifact creation processes
3. **Artifact Storage (Nexus)**: Securely stores versioned application binaries
4. **Quality Gates (Sonarqube)**: Enforces code quality standards and test coverage
5. **Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)**: Manages Kubernetes infrastructure declaratively
6. **GitOps Engine (ArgoCD)**: Ensures deployment state matches Git definitions
7. **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes)**: Manages application containers
8. **Monitoring Stack**: Tracks application and infrastructure health and performance

The workflow connects these components into a seamless pipeline where code changes automatically flow through verification, building, and deployment stages while maintaining observability.

## Key Features

- **Complete CI/CD Automation**: End-to-end pipeline from code commit to deployment
- **GitOps with ArgoCD**: App of Apps pattern for multi-environment deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform-managed Kubernetes with reusable modules
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Separate dev and prod configurations
- **Advanced Flask Application**: Rate limiting, metrics collection, and health monitoring
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated functional, security, and metrics tests
- **Code Quality Enforcement**: Static analysis, security scanning, and Sonarqube integration
- **Artifact Management**: Versioned binary storage with Nexus
- **Containerized Development**: Docker Compose for consistent local environment
- **Detailed Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics collection with Grafana dashboards
- **Alerting**: Configurable thresholds with Alertmanager integration

## Components

### Version Control with GitLab

GitLab serves as the central source code repository, providing:
- Version control for application code
- CI/CD integration with Jenkins
- Repository for deployment configurations
- Separate branch for ArgoCD configurations

### Continuous Integration with Jenkins

Jenkins orchestrates the CI process with a pipeline that:
- Runs automated tests with pytest
- Performs static code analysis with Ruff
- Conducts security scanning with Bandit
- Analyzes code quality with Sonarqube
- Builds application binaries with PyInstaller
- Uploads artifacts to Nexus repository
- Updates deployment configurations
- Creates dedicated ArgoCD branch

### Artifact Management with Nexus

Nexus provides a central repository for:
- Storing versioned application binaries
- Managing latest and timestamped releases
- Providing a reliable artifact source for deployments

### Infrastructure Management with Terraform

Terraform enables infrastructure as code by:
- Creating and configuring Kind Kubernetes clusters
- Setting up ArgoCD with the App of Apps pattern
- Managing Kubernetes resources with reusable modules
- Connecting cluster to external services like Nexus

### GitOps Deployment with ArgoCD

ArgoCD implements GitOps practices by:
- Using the App of Apps pattern for hierarchical management
- Automatically synchronizing Git changes to the cluster
- Supporting multiple environments (dev, prod)
- Self-healing deployments that maintain desired state
- Providing visibility into deployment status and history

### Application Deployment with Helm

Helm charts provide declarative application management:
- Environment-specific configurations via values files
- Consistent deployment templates
- Support for versioned releases
- Integration with Nexus for artifact retrieval

### Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

The monitoring stack delivers comprehensive observability:
- Application metrics from the Flask `/metrics` endpoint
- Pipeline performance metrics from Jenkins
- Container and system metrics from cAdvisor
- Custom dashboards for different aspects of the system
- Alerting based on defined thresholds

## Workflow

The CI/CD workflow follows these steps:

1. **Code Commit**: Developer pushes changes to GitLab main branch
2. **CI Pipeline**: Jenkins tests, analyzes, builds and packages the application
3. **Artifact Storage**: Binary is versioned and stored in Nexus
4. **GitOps Update**: Jenkins updates Helm chart and ArgoCD branch
5. **Automatic Deployment**: ArgoCD detects changes and syncs applications to Kubernetes
6. **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Applications deploy to dev and prod environments
7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Prometheus collects metrics from all components
8. **Performance Visualization**: Grafana displays real-time metrics and trends

This workflow embodies the principle of continuous delivery by providing a reliable, repeatable path to production with built-in quality gates and observability.
