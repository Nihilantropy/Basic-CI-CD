# CI/CD Project 3 - Implementation Roadmap

## 1. Documentation & Strategy Phase

- [x] **1.1 Requirements Analysis**
  - [x] Document Subject 3 requirements in detail
  - [x] Identify integration points with existing CI/CD infrastructure
  - [x] Define key metrics to collect from Flask application and Jenkins

- [ ] **1.2 Architecture Planning**
  - [ ] Design monitoring infrastructure architecture
  - [ ] Document data flow between components
  - [ ] Create reference architecture diagram for the monitoring stack

- [ ] **1.3 Tool Selection & Strategy**
  - [ ] Evaluate and document Prometheus integration approach
  - [ ] Define metrics collection strategy for Flask application
  - [ ] Determine Jenkins monitoring approach
  - [ ] Document Grafana dashboard requirements

## 2. Environment Enhancement

- [ ] **2.1 Docker Compose Configuration**
  - [ ] Add Prometheus and Grafana services
  - [ ] Configure persistent storage for metrics data
  - [ ] Set up proper networking between services
  - [ ] Update Makefile for new services

- [ ] **2.2 Monitoring Infrastructure Setup**
  - [ ] Configure Prometheus for metrics collection
