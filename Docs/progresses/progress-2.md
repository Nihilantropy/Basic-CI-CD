# Day 1

### Project & Team Organization

### Rate limiting in flask application (https://flask-limiter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

### Created a more modular and scalable project structure for flask-app

### Created different types of env, custom via FLASK_ENV var by name values ("development", "production", "testing")

### Created app specific tests for routes and rate limits (can be run with pytest)

### Using blueprint for app routes

### Utilizing version.info file for flask-app version tag

### Switched to global request rate limits (all addressed, all endpoints)

### Using centralized and customizable values in config.py to update request rate limits and default retry time

### Worked on bash script to test rate limits reliability

### Updated Dockerfile for custom docker agent for Jenkins pipeline

### Flask app is done! Next: Jenkins pipeline
