# CI/CD PROJECT - 3

Starting from CI/CD projects 1 and 2, integrate the following requirements

---

## 1 - Environment Configuration
● Add a centralized logging service with Prometheus and Grafana that tracks and visualizes the logs of the application and Jenkins

## 2 - Python Application Development
● Add a new endpoint "/metrics" that returns basic metrics (e.g., number of requests received, uptime, etc)

## 3 - Integrate the dashboards
Integrate the application metrics into the monitoring system, making them visible in a dedicated screen on Grafana and create a specific dashboard for Jenkins that shows the component status and relevant information about the pipelines such as number of executions, average duration, and recent outcomes
