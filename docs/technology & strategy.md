# Tool Selection & Monitoring Strategy

## 1. Prometheus Integration Approach

### Selected Technology: Prometheus

**Rationale for Selection:**
- Time-series database specifically designed for metrics
- Pull-based architecture fits well with our containerized infrastructure
- Large ecosystem of integrations, especially for Flask and Jenkins
- Strong query language (PromQL) for data analysis
- Efficient storage format for time-series data

### Integration Method

We will implement a pull-based integration model where:

1. **Components expose metrics endpoints:**
   - Flask application will expose a `/metrics` endpoint (default Prometheus format)
   - Jenkins will expose a `/prometheus` endpoint through the Prometheus plugin

2. **Prometheus scraping configuration:**
   ```yaml
   scrape_configs:
     - job_name: 'flask-app'
       scrape_interval: 15s
       metrics_path: '/metrics'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['flask-app:5000']
     
     - job_name: 'jenkins'
       scrape_interval: 30s
       metrics_path: '/prometheus'
       static_configs:
         - targets: ['jenkins:8080']
   ```

3. **Data retention and storage:**
   - Metrics will be retained for 15 days by default
   - Storage requirements estimated at 2GB based on expected metrics volume
   - Will use persistent Docker volumes for data storage

## 2. Flask Application Metrics Collection Strategy

### Client Library: prometheus-client

**Implementation Approach:**
- Add `prometheus-client` to application dependencies
- Create a dedicated metrics module for centralized management
- Instrument the application using a combination of:
  - Decorators for route-specific metrics
  - Middleware for global request metrics
  - Direct instrumentation for application-specific metrics

### Core Metrics Implementation

1. **Request Metrics:**
   ```python
   # Counter for total requests
   REQUEST_COUNT = Counter(
       'http_requests_total',
       'Total count of HTTP requests',
       ['method', 'endpoint', 'status']
   )
   
   # Histogram for request duration
   REQUEST_LATENCY = Histogram(
       'http_request_duration_seconds',
       'HTTP request latency in seconds',
       ['method', 'endpoint']
   )
   
   # Gauge for in-flight requests
   IN_FLIGHT = Gauge(
       'http_requests_in_flight',
       'Current number of HTTP requests in flight'
   )
   ```

2. **Rate Limit Metrics:**
   ```python
   # Counter for rate limit hits
   RATE_LIMIT_HITS = Counter(
       'rate_limit_hits_total',
       'Total number of rate limit hits'
   )
   
   # Gauge for remaining requests in rate limit window
   RATE_LIMIT_REMAINING = Gauge(
       'rate_limit_remaining',
       'Remaining requests in the current rate limit window'
   )
   ```

3. **Application Metrics:**
   ```python
   # Gauge for application info (allows version tracking)
   APP_INFO = Gauge(
       'app_info',
       'Application information',
       ['version', 'python_version']
   )
   
   # Gauge for application uptime
   UPTIME = Gauge(
       'app_uptime_seconds',
       'Application uptime in seconds'
   )
   ```

### Instrumentation Strategy

1. **Request Monitoring:**
   - Create a Flask middleware to track all requests automatically
   - Record request counts, latency, and status codes
   - Track in-flight requests with context managers

2. **Rate Limit Monitoring:**
   - Instrument the rate limiting module to expose metrics
   - Track both successful and rate-limited requests
   - Monitor remaining capacity in the rate limit window

3. **Application Monitoring:**
   - Set application information on startup
   - Schedule regular updates of uptime metrics
   - Track version changes

## 3. Jenkins Monitoring Approach

### Plugin Selection: Prometheus Metrics Plugin

**Configuration Strategy:**
- Install "Prometheus Metrics" plugin via Jenkins plugin manager
- Configure access controls for the metrics endpoint
- Enable metrics collection for all pipelines
- Add system metrics collection

### Jenkins Metrics to Collect

1. **System Metrics:**
   - Jenkins executor utilization
   - Build queue length and wait times
   - System resource usage (memory, CPU)

2. **Build Metrics:**
   - Build duration by job and stage
   - Success and failure rates
   - Build frequency
   - Pipeline stage performance

3. **Pipeline Metrics:**
   - Stage duration by job
   - Stage failure rates
   - Job execution frequency
   - Build stability metrics

### Security Considerations

- Metrics endpoint will be secured with Jenkins authentication
- Only expose necessary metrics to avoid information leakage
- Use role-based access control to restrict metrics access
- Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in metrics

## 4. Grafana Dashboard Requirements

### Data Source Configuration

- Primary data source: Prometheus
- Connection details:
  - URL: `http://prometheus:9090`
  - Access: Server (default)
  - No authentication for internal access

### Required Dashboards

1. **Flask Application Dashboard:**
   - **Panel Types:**
     - Request rate graph (counters)
     - Response time histogram
     - Error rate graph
     - Rate limit tracking
     - Version information
     - Uptime display
   - **Layout:** 
     - 2x3 grid with logical grouping
     - Key metrics prominently displayed
     - Detailed metrics in expandable panels

2. **Jenkins Pipeline Dashboard:**
   - **Panel Types:**
     - Build success/failure gauge
     - Build duration graph
     - Pipeline stage heatmap
     - Build frequency graph
     - Queue status
   - **Layout:**
     - Summary statistics at the top
     - Detailed build metrics in the middle
     - System health metrics at the bottom

3. **System Overview Dashboard:**
   - **Panel Types:**
     - Service status indicators
     - Resource usage graphs
     - Overall request volume
     - Error rates across services
     - Build pipeline status
   - **Layout:**
     - Alert section at the top
     - Service health overview in the middle
     - Detailed system metrics at the bottom

### Visualization Requirements

- **Color Scheme:**
  - Red/green for status indicators
  - Blue gradient for time-based metrics
  - Heat maps for duration distributions
  - Consistent color scheme across dashboards

- **Thresholds:**
  - Define warning thresholds for request rates
  - Set critical thresholds for error rates
  - Configure alerts for excessive build durations
  - Highlight rate limit approaches

- **Time Range Controls:**
  - Default to last 6 hours
  - Provide quick selectors for common time ranges
  - Allow custom time range selection

## Implementation Plan

1. **Prometheus Client Integration:**
   - Add to Flask application requirements
   - Create metrics module
   - Implement core instrumentation

2. **Jenkins Plugin Setup:**
   - Install and configure plugin
   - Test metrics endpoint
   - Document available metrics

3. **Dashboard Creation:**
   - Develop dashboards iteratively
   - Start with core metrics
   - Add advanced visualizations as metrics mature

This strategy provides a comprehensive approach to implementing monitoring across our CI/CD infrastructure with minimal disruption to existing services.
