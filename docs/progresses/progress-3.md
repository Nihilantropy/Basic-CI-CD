# Day 1

## Phase 1

## Planning & Strategy Phase

### Requirements Analysis (Completed)

- Comprehensive breakdown of Subject 3 monitoring requirements
- Defined integration points with existing CI/CD infrastructure
- Established metrics inventory for Flask application and Jenkins:
  - HTTP request metrics (counts, duration, status codes)
  - Rate limiting statistics
  - Application metrics (version, uptime)
  - Build performance metrics
  - Pipeline stage metrics

### Architecture Planning (Completed)

- Designed comprehensive monitoring infrastructure using Prometheus and Grafana
- Created detailed data flow diagrams showing metrics collection paths
- Developed component architecture diagram showing integration with existing CI/CD services
- Specified Prometheus configuration for scraping both Flask application and Jenkins metrics
- Defined security model for monitoring infrastructure

### Tool Selection & Strategy (Completed)

- Selected Prometheus as primary metrics collection platform with detailed integration approach
- Developed Flask application metrics strategy using prometheus-client library
- Defined core metrics implementation for requests, rate limiting, and application statistics
- Specified Jenkins monitoring approach with Prometheus Metrics Plugin
- Created comprehensive dashboard requirements and visualization strategy

## Phase 2

## Environment Enhancement Phase

### Docker Compose Configuration (Completed)

- Added Prometheus service to Docker Compose with:
  - Official Prometheus image with proper configuration
  - Persistent volume storage for time-series data
  - Default scraping configuration for services
  - Custom retention settings (15 days)
  - Web interface access on port 9090

- Added Grafana service to Docker Compose with:
  - Official Grafana image configured for our environment
  - Environment variables stored securely in .env file
  - Persistent volume for dashboard configurations
  - Provisioned data sources for Prometheus
  - Web interface access on port 3000

- Set up proper networking between services:
  - Connected monitoring services to existing gitlab_network
  - Ensured all services can communicate with each other
  - Maintained isolation where appropriate

- Updated Makefile to include:
  - New services in the PROJECT_SERVICES list
  - Additional volumes in the PROJECT_VOLUMES list
  - Consistent build and management commands

### Monitoring Infrastructure Setup (Completed)

- Configured Prometheus for metrics collection:
  - Set up Prometheus with appropriate scraping configuration
  - Implemented proper retention policies (15 days)
  - Configured targets for self-monitoring and other services
  - Added debugging and logging for troubleshooting

- Set up Grafana with Prometheus data source:
  - Created and configured Prometheus data source connection
  - Set up automatic provisioning of data sources
  - Implemented basic system overview dashboard
  - Configured dashboard provisioning for persistence

- Established basic security for monitoring components:
  - Set up authentication for Grafana
  - Disabled anonymous access
  - Implemented secure cookie settings
  - Configured appropriate access controls
  
- Developed comprehensive testing framework:
  - Created bash scripts to validate endpoint availability
  - Implemented tests for service connectivity
  - Added debugging for network resolution issues
  - Verified proper authentication mechanisms
  
- Troubleshot and resolved initial configuration issues:
  - Fixed HTTP status code validation for redirecting endpoints
  - Addressed container networking and DNS resolution
  - Implemented improved target configuration for reliability
  - Added detailed logging for monitoring troubleshooting
