  - Maintained isolation where appropriate

- Updated Makefile to include:
  - New services in the PROJECT_SERVICES list
  - Additional volumes in the PROJECT_VOLUMES list
  - Consistent build and management commands

### Monitoring Infrastructure Setup (Completed)

- Configured Prometheus for metrics collection:
  - Set up Prometheus with appropriate scraping configuration
  - Implemented proper retention policies (15 days)
  - Configured targets for self-monitoring and other services
  - Added debugging and logging for troubleshooting

- Set up Grafana with Prometheus data source:
  - Created and configured Prometheus data source connection
  - Set up automatic provisioning of data sources
  - Implemented basic system overview dashboard
  - Configured dashboard provisioning for persistence

- Established basic security for monitoring components:
  - Set up authentication for Grafana
  - Disabled anonymous access
  - Implemented secure cookie settings
  - Configured appropriate access controls
  
- Developed comprehensive testing framework:
  - Created bash scripts to validate endpoint availability
  - Implemented tests for service connectivity
  - Added debugging for network resolution issues
  - Verified proper authentication mechanisms

## Phase 3

## Flask Application Enhancement Phase

### Metrics Implementation (Completed)

- Integrated Prometheus client library into the Flask application:
  - Added prometheus-client to requirements.txt
  - Created dedicated metrics.py module for centralized metrics management
  - Implemented custom metrics collector class for application monitoring

- Developed comprehensive metrics collection for the application:
  - HTTP request counters by endpoint, method, and status code
  - Request duration histograms for performance tracking
  - In-flight request gauges for concurrency monitoring
  - Rate limiting metrics (hit count and remaining capacity)
  - Application information metrics (version, uptime, start time)

- Implemented the `/metrics` endpoint with standardized Prometheus format:
  - Created a dedicated endpoint handler in the metrics collector
  - Configured proper content type and formatting
  - Used a custom registry for better metrics organization
  - Implemented uptime tracking that updates on each metrics request

- Enhanced application architecture to support metrics:
  - Modified application factory to initialize metrics collection
  - Added before/after request handlers for automatic tracking
  - Ensured metrics collection has minimal performance impact
  - Implemented proper logging throughout metrics code

### Testing & Integration (Completed)

- Developed comprehensive test suite for metrics functionality:
  - Created specific test_metrics.py module for metrics testing
  - Implemented tests to verify metrics endpoint existence and content type
  - Added tests to validate metrics format and content
  - Created tests to ensure metrics increment correctly after requests
  - Added detailed raw output validation for debugging

- Ensured proper metrics exposure for Prometheus scraping:
  - Updated Kubernetes deployment template with Prometheus annotations
  - Added port configuration for metrics scraping
  - Configured service to expose metrics endpoint
  - Ensured metrics are available both inside and outside the cluster

- Updated application documentation to reflect metrics capabilities:
  - Documented available metrics and their meanings
  - Provided examples of how to query metrics
  - Added detailed docstrings to all metrics-related code

## Phase 4

## Jenkins Monitoring Integration Phase

### Jenkins Metrics Configuration (Completed)

- Installed and configured Jenkins Prometheus plugin:
  - Added prometheus:latest and related metrics plugins to Jenkins
  - Configured the plugin to expose metrics at `/prometheus/` endpoint
  - Set metrics collection interval to 5 seconds
  - Enabled calculation of 50th, 95th, and 99th percentiles
  - Secured metrics endpoint with authentication

- Integrated metrics collection in Jenkins pipeline:
  - Enhanced cicdUtils.groovy with Prometheus metrics functions
  - Added pipeline execution metrics tracking
  - Implemented stage duration measurement
  - Set up build outcome metrics (success/failure rates)
  - Created metrics initialization and finalization functions

### Metrics Collection Validation (Completed)

- Verified metrics collection and availability:
  - Confirmed Prometheus is successfully scraping Jenkins metrics
  - Validated metric accuracy against Jenkins UI statistics
  - Tested pipeline metrics with actual build runs
  - Verified persistence of metrics beyond build completion
